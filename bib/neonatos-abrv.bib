abstract = {BACKGROUND: A better understanding of gender influences on fetal heart rate can help to improve analysis of the latter and perhaps elucidate the increased risk of perinatal death that occurs in males.

AIM: To assess differences in linear and complex heart rate dynamics according to fetal sex, in the antepartum period of normal term pregnancies, for patterns associated with fetal behavioural states.

STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: One hundred and eighty seven fetal heart rate segments of 10-minute duration, acquired with a system for computerized analysis of cardiotocograms and classified into fetal behavioural patterns A, B, C or D were analysed. They had been acquired from 24 female and 23 male term fetuses, with uneventful perinatal outcomes. Four different comparative studies between female and male fetuses were conducted, considering different adjustments for gestational age, weight and FHR pattern.

OUTCOME MEASURES: Indices of linear and nonlinear fetal heart rate variability, namely, long-term irregularity index, very low, low and high frequency spectral indices, approximate entropy and sample entropy.

RESULTS: Pattern B was the most frequent, both in female and male fetuses. Pattern A was more likely to be associated to female than male fetuses, whereas the opposite occurred with patterns C and D. Linear indices were significantly higher in male than in female fetuses, whereas the opposite occurred with nonlinear indices.

CONCLUSIONS: Male fetuses exhibited significantly more linear and significantly less complex fetal heart rate activity than female fetuses, expressing signs of a more active autonomous nervous system and of less active complexity control systems. These aspects may need to be considered when interpreting FHR tracings.},

abstract = {We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method does not use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as follows: First, we determine a parameter-free, universal, similarity distance, the normalized compression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files (singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical clustering method. The NCD is not restricted to a specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one of the authors, is provably optimal. However, the optimality comes at the price of using the noncomputable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We propose axioms to capture the real-world setting, and show that the NCD approximates optimality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (ternary tree) by a new quartet method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and available as public software, and is robust under choice of different compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics, virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics, we presented new evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.},

However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in theM-category case thatR\^{}\{ast\} leq R leq R\^{}\{ast\}(2 --MR\^{}\{ast\}/(M-1)), where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability is promising for assessing fetal condition. Before using spectral analysis for fetal monitoring it has to be determined whether there should be a correction for gestational age or behavioural state.

AIMS: Compare spectral values of heart rate variability between near term and post term fetuses during active and quiet sleep.

STUDY DESIGN: Case-control. Cases had a gestational age of > or =42 weeks; controls were 36 to 37 weeks. Fetuses were matched for birth weight percentile.

SUBJECTS: STAN registrations from healthy fetuses. For each fetus one 5-minute segment was selected during active and one during quiet sleep.

OUTCOME MEASURES: Absolute and normalized low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency power (0.4-1.5 Hz) of heart rate variability.

RESULTS: Twenty fetuses were included. No significant differences were found between cases and controls in absolute (481 and 429 respectively, P=0.88) or normalized low (0.78 and 0.80 respectively, P=0.50) or absolute (41 and 21 respectively, P=0.23) or normalized high frequency power (0.08 and 0.07 respectively, P=0.20) during active state. During rest, normalized low frequency power was lower (0.58 and 0.69 respectively, P=0.03) and absolute (16 and 10 respectively, P=0.04) and normalized high frequency power were higher (0.21 and 0.14 respectively, P=0.01) in cases compared to controls. Absolute and normalized low frequency power were higher during active state compared to rest in both groups (all P values <0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: We found sympathetic predominance during active state in fetuses around term. Post term parasympathetic modulation during rest was increased compared to near term.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictive value of each fetal heart rate (FHR) variable and of patterns of FHR variables for fetal asphyxia during labor.

METHODS: This matched case-control study included an asphyxia group of 71 term infants with umbilical artery base deficit greater than 16 mmol/L and a control group of 71 term infants with umbilical artery base deficit less than 8 mmol/L. Each FHR record available for the 4 hours before delivery was scored in 10-minute cycles for each FHR variable. Selected patterns of important FHR variables were examined during the last hour before delivery for their predictive value for fetal asphyxia.

RESULTS: The FHR variables associated with fetal asphyxia included absent and minimal baseline variability and late and prolonged decelerations. Fetal heart rate patterns with absent baseline variability were the most specific but identified only 17\% of the asphyxia group. The sensitivity of this test increased to 93\% with the addition of less specific patterns. The estimated positive predictive value ranged from 18.1\% to 2.6\%, and the negative predictive value ranged from 98.3\% to 99.5\%.

CONCLUSION: A narrow 1-hour window of FHR patterns including minimal baseline variability and late or prolonged decelerations will predict fetal asphyxial exposure before decompensation and newborn morbidity. Thus, with careful interpretation, predictive FHR patterns can be a useful screening test for fetal asphyxia. However, supplementary tests are required to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the large number of false-positive patterns to avoid unnecessary intervention.},

Its introduction in the clinical routine limited the occurrence of fetal problems leading to a reduction of the precocious child mortality. Nevertheless very poor indications on fetal pathologies can be inferred from the actual CTG analysis methods, either they consist of the clinician eye inspection or of automatic algorithms. A relevant amount of this unsatisfactory performance resides on the weakness of methods used for classifying fetal conditions and generate a risk alarm during pregnancy. In the paper three neural classifiers are proposed to discriminate among fetal behavioral states and among normal and pathological fetal conditions, on the basis of CTG recordings. All classifiers are fed by indexes extracted from fetal heart rate signal. Results show very promising performance towards the prediction of fetal outcomes on the set of collected FHR signals},

After asphyxia, infants can suffer from short- to long-term neurological sequelae, their severity depend upon the extent of the insult, the metabolic imbalance during the re-oxygenation period and the developmental state of the affected regions. Significant progresses in understanding of perinatal asphyxia pathophysiology have achieved. However, predictive diagnostics and personalised therapeutic interventions are still under initial development. Now the emphasis is on early non-invasive diagnosis approach, as well as, in identifying new therapeutic targets to improve individual outcomes. In this review we discuss (i) specific biomarkers for early prediction of perinatal asphyxia outcome; (ii) short and long term sequelae; (iii) neurocircuitries involved; (iv) molecular pathways; (v) neuroinflammation systems; (vi) endogenous brain rescue systems, including activation of sentinel proteins and neurogenesis; and (vii) therapeutic targets for preventing or mitigating the effects produced by asphyxia.},

Methods for estimation of the entropy of a system represented by a time series are not, however, well suited to analysis of the short and noisy data sets encountered in cardiovascular and other biological studies. Pincus introduced approximate entropy (ApEn), a set of measures of system complexity closely related to entropy, which is easily applied to clinical cardiovascular and other time series. ApEn statistics, however, lead to inconsistent results. We have developed a new and related complexity measure, sample entropy (SampEn), and have compared ApEn and SampEn by using them to analyze sets of random numbers with known probabilistic character. We have also evaluated cross-ApEn and cross-SampEn, which use cardiovascular data sets to measure the similarity of two distinct time series. SampEn agreed with theory much more closely than ApEn over a broad range of conditions. The improved accuracy of SampEn statistics should make them useful in the study of experimental clinical cardiovascular and other biological time series.

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Human factors can have an important impact on cardiotocography (CTG) interpretation and management decisions, and therefore may directly affect obstetrical outcomes.

RECENT FINDINGS: It has been well demonstrated that there is wide observer disagreement over CTG interpretation, particularly in the evaluation of variability, decelerations, and overall tracing classification. The reasons behind this are still incompletely understood, but poor reproducibility can have a profound impact on the technology's accuracy and on its efficacy. Some scientific societies have recently revised their guidelines for CTG interpretation, but no up-to-date universally accepted recommendation exists. In spite of some approximation between the major guideline sets, important differences still exist between them, and they remain complex and prone to memory decay. Regular training in CTG interpretation appears to result in increased knowledge, better observer agreement, and improved quality of care. Computer analysis has also been developed, but remains heavily dependent on staff to confirm interpretation and to decide clinical management.

SUMMARY: An international consensus, comprising simpler and more objective interpretation guidelines, together with regular staff training, and improved decision support systems seem to be the way forward for this technology.},

It decomposes the test image using two-level Haar wavelet transform into nine subbands (here the image itself is considered as the LL0 subband). For each subband, the characteristic function is calculated. The first and second statistical moments of the characteristic functions from all the subbands are selected to form an 18-dimensional feature vector for steganalysis. The Bayes classifier is utilized in classification. All of the 1096 images from the CorelDraw image database are used in our extensive experimental work. With randomly selected 100 images for training and the remaining 996 images for testing, the proposed steganalysis system can steadily achieve a correct classification rate of 79\% for the non-blind Spread Spectrum watermarking algorithm proposed by Cox et ai, 88\% for the blind Spread Spectrum watermarking algorithm proposed by Piva et ai, and 91\% for a generic LSB embedding method, thus indicating significant advancement in steganalysis.},

abstract = {Antepartum fetal monitoring based on the classical cardiotocography (CTG) is a noninvasive and simple tool for checking fetal status. Its introduction in the clinical routine limited the occurrence of fetal problems leading to a reduction of the precocious child mortality. Nevertheless, very poor indications on fetal pathologies can be inferred from the even automatic CTG analysis methods, which are actually employed. The feeling is that fetal heart rate (FHR) signals and uterine contractions carry much more information on fetal state than is usually extracted by classical analysis methods. In particular, FHR signal contains indications about the neural development of the fetus. However, the methods actually adopted for judging a CTG trace as "abnormal" give weak predictive indications about fetal dangers. We propose a new methodological approach for the CTG monitoring, based on a multiparametric FHR analysis, which includes spectral parameters from autoregressive models and nonlinear algorithms (approximate entropy). This preliminary study considers 14 normal fetuses, eight cases of gestational (maternal) diabetes, and 13 intrauterine growth retarded fetuses. A comparison with the traditional time domain analysis is also included. This paper shows that the proposed new parameters are able to separate normal from pathological fetuses. Results constitute the first step for realizing a new clinical classification system for the early diagnosis of most common fetal pathologies.},

Two examples are given to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm. The algorithm is compared with the quasi-log-likelihood radio (qLLRC), square-law (SLC), and phase-based (PBC) classifiers. The algorithm is outperformed by q LLRC at low CNR but is comparable to SLC and is better than PBC. The qLLRC algorithm is only valid at CNR<0 dB and can be used only to discriminate between BPSK and QPSK signals, whereas the moments algorithm is more general},

abstract = {Reduced cerebral function after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia is an early indicator of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Near-infrared spectroscopy offers a clinically relevant means of detecting impaired cerebral metabolism from the measurement of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between postinsult CMRO2 and duration of hypoxia-ischemia in piglets. Twelve piglets were subjected to randomly selected durations of hypoxia-ischemia (5-28 min) and five animals served as controls. Measurements of CMRO2 were taken before and for 24 h after hypoxia-ischemia. Histology was carried out in nine piglets (six insults, three controls) to estimate brain injury. In the first 4 h after the insult, average CMRO2 of the insult group was significantly depressed (33 +/- 3\% reduction compared with controls) and by 8 h, a significant correlation developed, which persisted for the remainder of the study, between CMRO2 and the duration of ischemia. Histologic staining suggested little brain damage resulted from shorter insult durations and considerable damage from more prolonged insults. This study demonstrated that near-infrared spectroscopy could detect early changes in CMRO2 after hypoxia-ischemia for a range of insult severities and CMRO2 could be used to distinguish insult severity by 8 h after the insult.},

We also modeled FHR baseline with a linear fit and FHR variability unrelated to UP using the power spectral density, computed from an auto-regressive model. Using a perinatal database of normal and pathological cases, we trained support-vector-machine classifiers with feature sets from these models. We used the classification in a detection process. We obtained the best results with a detector that combined the decisions of classifiers using both feature sets. It detected half of the pathological cases, with very few false positives (7.5\%), 1 h and 40 min before delivery. This would leave sufficient time for an appropriate clinical response. These results clearly demonstrate the utility of our method for the early detection of cases needing clinical intervention.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a reliable reflection of the many physiological factors modulating the normal rhythm of the heart. In fact, they provide a powerful means of observing the interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. It shows that the structure generating the signal is not only simply linear, but also involves nonlinear contributions. Heart rate (HR) is a nonstationary signal; its variation may contain indicators of current disease, or warnings about impending cardiac diseases. The indicators may be present at all times or may occur at random-during certain intervals of the day. It is strenuous and time consuming to study and pinpoint abnormalities in voluminous data collected over several hours. Hence, HR variation analysis (instantaneous HR against time axis) has become a popular noninvasive tool for assessing the activities of the autonomic nervous system. Computer based analytical tools for in-depth study of data over daylong intervals can be very useful in diagnostics. Therefore, the HRV signal parameters, extracted and analyzed using computers, are highly useful in diagnostics. In this paper, we have discussed the various applications of HRV and different linear, frequency domain, wavelet domain, nonlinear techniques used for the analysis of the HRV.},

Detection of foetal hypoxia during labour based on the pattern recognition of heart rate signals suffers from high observer variability and low specificity. We describe a new automated hypoxia detection method using time-frequency analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) signals. This approach uses features extracted from the instantaneous frequency and instantaneous amplitude of HRV signal components as well as features based on matrix decomposition of the signals' time-frequency distributions using singular value decomposition and non-negative matrix factorization. The classification between hypoxia and non-hypoxia data is performed using a support vector machine classifier. The proposed method is tested on a dataset obtained from a newborn piglet model with a controlled hypoxic insult. The chosen HRV features show strong performance compared to conventional spectral features and other existing methods of hypoxia detection with a sensitivity 93.3 \%, specificity 98.3 \% and accuracy 95.8 \%. The high predictive value of this approach to detecting hypoxia is a substantial step towards developing a more accurate and reliable hypoxia detection method for use in human foetal monitoring.},
